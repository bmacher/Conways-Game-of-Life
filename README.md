# Conways Game of Life with basic Javascript

This repository contains a simple JS script to simulate Conways Game of Life. This means that no additional libraries (jQuery, Angular,...) are used.

> "The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970." ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life "Conway's Game of Life"))

The following four rules determine whether a cell will live or not:

1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by underpopulation.
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

## There are some interesting start generations
