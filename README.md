# Conways Game of Life with Javascript

I wanted to learn JavaScript and thought it would be the best way to write Conways Game of life with it. To get basic knowledge about it I started with pure JavaScript, that means I haven't used any frameworks. Now I want to get the same result by using jQuery and Angular and maybe React to discover common JS frameworks. The last step will be an Angular frontend and Node.js backend to learn about REST API and AJAX.

Implementation with
- [Basic JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) ✅
- [jQuery](https://jquery.com) ✅
- [Angular](https://angular.io) & [Bootstrap](https://www.getbootstrap.com)
- Angluar + [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- ([React](https://reactjs.org))

I get all my knowledge from:
- [SoloLearn](https://www.sololearn.com) (JS, jQuery, HTML and CSS courses)
- [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com)
- [Traversy Media](https://www.youtube.com/user/TechGuyWeb) (awsome youtube tutorials)
- Homepage of each framework (see above)

## About Conways Game of Life

> "The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970." ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life "Conway's Game of Life"))

The following four rules determine whether a cell will live or not:

1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by underpopulation.
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
